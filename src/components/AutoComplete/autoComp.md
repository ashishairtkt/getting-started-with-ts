Explanation of the Code
The InputBox component is a React functional component that includes an input field with auto-suggestions. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each part:

State Management:

textInput: Holds the current value of the input field.
loading: Indicates whether data is being fetched or processed.
selectedIndex: Tracks the index of the currently selected suggestion.
suggestions: Stores the list of suggestions fetched from an API.
Debouncing:

debouncedTextInput: This value is the debounced version of textInput using a custom hook useDebounce. It introduces a delay (300ms) before updating debouncedTextInput to reduce the number of API calls or computations.
Data Fetching:

useEffect: Fetches user data from an API (jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) when the component mounts. The fetched data is stored in the suggestions state.
Input Change Handler:

handleInputChange: Updates textInput state when the input value changes.
Loading State Management:

useEffect: Sets the loading state based on textInput. If textInput is not empty, it sets loading to true.
Debounced Input Effect:

useEffect: Sets loading to false when debouncedTextInput is updated.
Suggestion Click Handler:

handleSuggestionClick: Updates the input value and selected index when a suggestion is clicked.
Text Highlighting:

highlightText: Highlights the matching part of the suggestion text. Splits the text and wraps the matching part with a span element having a highlight class.
Filtering Suggestions:

filterResult: This memoized value filters suggestions based on debouncedTextInput. It uses useMemo to ensure the filtering logic runs only when debouncedTextInput or suggestions change.
Rendering:

Renders an input field.
Displays a "Loading..." message when loading is true and textInput is not empty.
Displays filtered suggestions with the matching part highlighted.
Use Case
The InputBox component is useful in scenarios where you need to provide real-time suggestions or auto-completions based on user input. Here are some use cases:

Search Boxes:

Implementing a search box where users can type keywords and receive real-time suggestions from a database or an API.
Autocomplete Fields:

Autocomplete fields in forms where users need to select from a predefined list, such as city names, country names, or user names.
Dynamic Filtering:

Any application that requires dynamic filtering of a list based on user input, such as a contacts list, product catalog, or a list of tags.
Example Scenario
Imagine you have a user registration form where users need to select their company from a list. As users type the name of their company, the InputBox component fetches company names from an API and displays matching suggestions. This improves the user experience by making it easier and faster for users to find and select their company, reducing errors in manual entry.

By debouncing the input, the component minimizes the number of API calls, reducing load on the server and improving performance. The memoized filtering logic ensures efficient re-rendering, making the component responsive and scalable.
